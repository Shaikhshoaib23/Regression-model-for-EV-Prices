# Regression-model-for-EV-Prices
This is my college project in which we had to use a data set and compare any 3 or 4 regression models to find out which one is best fit for the selected data. Here i went with Random forest, SVR, Ridge  and Multiple linear regression. I first did data cleaning and pre processing  and data visualization to better understand about it.
